# WIT
> Web Innovative Talent Award Project

### WIT Detail
WIT was held in early 2020, in Dec 2019 to be exact. It was postponed due to the <b> Covid-19 </b> constraints. And the tournament entry was extended from Dec 2019 to March 2020. So, I and former classmates formed a group to compete in the competition. The awards were diversed into four categories which are 

1. Grand Prix ($2000 + Japan Tour)
2. Design Award ($700)
3. Technical Award ($700)
4. Team Award ($1000)

The Awards varied accordingly to their categories and as I have mentioned that we have created a team to compete, it was intentional that we were aiming for Team Award.  

### Project Detail

The Concept that we have adhered for the project was to represent well for our richness of culture, and we've figured a lot of people must have been completed in that area.
Therefore, We try to improvise into those inspired idea to compete. The whole project was about

- features of 12 Burmese months .
- Famous Pagodas in Major Cities.
- Events that are held in those 12 burmese months.

The whole world has been refined onto the digital form since the pandemic hit and even since then, a lot of information can be thoroughly searched online. And the project was to provide a library system to those who are learning about burmese culture and its traditional months.

The projects was developed with purely front-end programming languages 

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### Project Accomplishment

It was an unexpected project for us to undertake as we have been struggling with loads of academic project. But however, We've managed to pull through and submit the project to the panels of judges.
